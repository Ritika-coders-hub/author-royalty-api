✍️ Author Royalty API

A backend REST API to manage authors, books, sales, and royalties with real-time earnings calculation.

Tech Stack: Node.js with Express.js for simplicity and speed, CORS for cross-origin testing, and in-memory JSON for easy data handling without a database.

Assumptions: Data is stored in memory; withdrawals are marked pending; API focuses on correctness and clarity.

Time Spent: Approximately 8-9 hours, including development, debugging, and deployment.
